# Test-Driven Development for n8n Workflows

## What is TDD for n8n?

Test-Driven Development (TDD) for n8n is a methodology where you write tests for your workflows BEFORE implementing them. This approach fundamentally changes how you think about workflow development:

1. **Define expected behavior first** - What should the workflow accomplish?
2. **Write tests that verify this behavior** - How will you know it works?
3. **Implement the workflow** - Make the tests pass
4. **Refactor and optimize** - Improve while keeping tests green

## Why TDD for n8n Workflows?

### Traditional Approach Problems
- Build workflow → Test manually → Hope it works in production
- Difficult to catch edge cases
- No regression protection
- Hard to refactor safely

### TDD Benefits
- **Clear requirements** - Tests document expected behavior
- **Early error detection** - Catch issues before deployment
- **Confident refactoring** - Tests ensure changes don't break functionality
- **Living documentation** - Tests show how workflows should behave
- **Reduced debugging time** - Issues caught early are easier to fix

## The TDD Cycle for n8n

### 1. Red Phase: Write a Failing Test
```json
{
  "name": "Customer data enrichment test",
  "workflows": [{
    "templateName": "customer_enrichment",
    "name": "Enrich Customer Data",
    "isPrimary": true
  }],
  "input": {
    "email": "john@example.com"
  },
  "assertions": [{
    "description": "Should return enriched customer data",
    "assertion": "result.fullName !== undefined"
  }, {
    "description": "Should include company information",
    "assertion": "result.company !== undefined"
  }]
}
```

### 2. Green Phase: Implement the Workflow
Create the minimal workflow that makes the test pass:
- Add webhook trigger
- Add data enrichment node
- Return required fields

### 3. Refactor Phase: Improve the Implementation
- Add error handling
- Optimize API calls
- Add data validation
- Improve performance

## TDD Workflow Development Process

### Step 1: Understand Requirements
Before writing any tests, clearly define:
- What triggers the workflow?
- What data does it process?
- What should it output?
- What are the error scenarios?

### Step 2: Write Test Scenarios
Create comprehensive test cases covering:
- Happy path (normal operation)
- Edge cases (empty data, large datasets)
- Error scenarios (API failures, invalid data)
- Performance requirements

### Step 3: Implement Incrementally
1. Start with the simplest test
2. Write minimal workflow code to pass
3. Add next test
4. Extend workflow
5. Repeat until all tests pass

### Step 4: Refactor with Confidence
With tests in place, you can:
- Optimize node configurations
- Restructure workflow logic
- Add new features
- Remove redundancy

## Example: Building a Data Sync Workflow with TDD

### 1. Define Requirements
"Sync customer data from CRM to database when webhook is triggered"

### 2. Write First Test
```json
{
  "name": "Basic customer sync",
  "input": {
    "customerId": "123",
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "name": "Test User"
  },
  "assertions": [{
    "description": "Should return success status",
    "assertion": "result.status === 'success'"
  }]
}
```

### 3. Implement Basic Workflow
- Webhook trigger
- Database insert node
- Return success response

### 4. Add Edge Case Tests
```json
{
  "name": "Handle missing email",
  "input": {
    "customerId": "124",
    "name": "No Email User"
  },
  "assertions": [{
    "description": "Should handle missing email gracefully",
    "assertion": "result.status === 'success' && result.warnings.includes('email_missing')"
  }]
}
```

### 5. Enhance Workflow
- Add email validation
- Add warning system
- Handle optional fields

## Best Practices for TDD with n8n

### 1. Start Small
- Begin with simple workflows
- One test at a time
- Build complexity gradually

### 2. Test Business Logic, Not Implementation
```json
// Good: Tests business requirement
{
  "assertion": "result.customer.isActive === true"
}

// Bad: Tests specific node output
{
  "assertion": "result.$node['Set'].json.active === true"
}
```

### 3. Use Descriptive Test Names
```json
{
  "name": "Should enrich customer data with company info when email is provided",
  "name": "Should skip enrichment for free email domains"
}
```

### 4. Test Error Scenarios
```json
{
  "name": "Handle API rate limit",
  "mockResponses": {
    "apiNode": { "status": 429, "error": "Rate limit exceeded" }
  },
  "assertions": [{
    "assertion": "result.status === 'queued_for_retry'"
  }]
}
```

### 5. Keep Tests Independent
Each test should:
- Set up its own data
- Not depend on other tests
- Clean up after itself

## Common TDD Patterns for n8n

### 1. Data Transformation Testing
```json
{
  "name": "Transform order data",
  "input": {
    "orders": [
      { "id": 1, "amount": "100.50", "currency": "USD" },
      { "id": 2, "amount": "75.25", "currency": "EUR" }
    ]
  },
  "assertions": [
    { "assertion": "result.totalUSD > 0" },
    { "assertion": "result.orders.every(o => typeof o.amount === 'number')" }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Integration Testing
```json
{
  "name": "CRM to Database sync",
  "credentials": ["CRM_API", "DATABASE"],
  "input": { "syncType": "full" },
  "assertions": [
    { "assertion": "result.recordsSynced > 0" },
    { "assertion": "result.errors.length === 0" }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Webhook Response Testing
```json
{
  "name": "Webhook authentication",
  "input": {
    "headers": { "x-api-key": "invalid" }
  },
  "assertions": [
    { "assertion": "result.statusCode === 401" },
    { "assertion": "result.error === 'Unauthorized'" }
  ]
}
```

## Measuring TDD Success

### Metrics to Track
1. **Test Coverage** - Percentage of workflows with tests
2. **Defect Rate** - Issues found in production vs testing
3. **Development Velocity** - Time from requirement to deployment
4. **Refactoring Frequency** - How often workflows are improved

### Signs of Effective TDD
- Fewer production issues
- Faster feature development
- Confident deployments
- Easy onboarding of new team members

## Getting Started with TDD

1. **Choose a simple workflow** to practice with
2. **Write one test** for the happy path
3. **Implement** just enough to pass
4. **Add edge cases** one at a time
5. **Refactor** when all tests pass
6. **Repeat** for more complex workflows

Remember: TDD is a skill that improves with practice. Start small, be patient, and focus on the long-term benefits of having a comprehensive test suite for your n8n workflows.
